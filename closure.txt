1. What is "closure"?
"Closure" is a function, which can refer to local variavles not copy. 

2. How "closure" works?
There are three features "closure" can do:
 1."Closure" can refer to itself.
 2."Closure" can refer to outside variavles in a scope that it belongs.
 3."Closure" can refer to global variables.
 Unlike other most common languages, we can access local variables after 
 the function. In other words, local variables are not destroyed after calling.
 
 
For example:
function showworks(where, who){
let closureWork = "I can access";

function output(){
return closureWork + where + " " + who;
}

return output();
}

showWorks("Outer", "Variables");// I can access Outer Variables
